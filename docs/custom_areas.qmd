If the area you want to model isn't [already generated](outputs.qmd), then you
can follow this guide to run SPC on a custom area. You must first [compile
SPC](installation.qmd).

## Specifying the area

SPC takes a newline-separated list of MSOAs in the `config/` directory as input, like [this](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/uatk-spc/blob/main/config/bristol.txt). You can generate this list from a LAD (local authority district). From the main SPC directory, run `python scripts/select_msoas.py`. Refer to `data/raw_data/referencedata/lookUp.csv` (only available after running SPC once) for all geographies available.

This script will create a new file, `config/your_region.txt`.

## Run SPC for the new area

From the main directory, just run:

```
cargo run --release -- config/your_region.txt
```

This will download some large files the first time. You'll wind up with
`data/output/your_region.pb` as output, as well as lots of intermediate files
in `data/raw_data/`. The next time you run this command (even on a different
study area), it should go much faster.


## (Optional) run SPC for lots of areas

If you want to run the program over lots of areas at once and are using mac/linux you can use a for loop in a terminal to repeatedly run SPC over all files in the config directory. For example, this will run SPC on all `.txt` files in the `config` directory:

```
for file in config/*.csv; do cargo run --release -- config/$file; done

```
