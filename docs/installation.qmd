You only need to compile SPC to run for a custom set of MSOAs. Just [download
existing output](outputs.qmd) if your study area matches what we provide.

## Dependencies

- **Rust**: The latest stable version of Rust:
  [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Compiling SPC

```shell
git clone https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/uatk-spc/
cd uatk-spc
# The next command will take a few minutes the first time you do it, to build external dependencies
cargo build --release
```

## Troubleshooting downloading

If you get an error `No such file or directory (os error 2)` it might be because a previous attempt to run SPC failed, and some necessary files were not fully downloaded. In these cases you could try deleting the `data/raw_data` directory and then running SPC again. It should automatically try to download the big files again.

If you have trouble downloading any of the large files, you can download them
manually. The logs will contain a line such as `Downloading https://ramp0storage.blob.core.windows.net/nationaldata/QUANT_RAMP_spc.tar.gz to data/raw_data/nationaldata/QUANT_RAMP_spc.tar.gz`. This tells you the URL to
retrieve, and where to put the output file. Note that SPC won't attempt to
download files if they already exist, so if you wind up with a partially
downloaded file, you have to manually remove it.
