Once you run SPC to generate a new study area based on your input file text, you will get in `/data/output` folder a `.pb` file. A .pb or [protocol buffer file](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview) efficiently encode the enriched synthetic population [schema](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/uatk-spc/blob/main/synthpop.proto). You
can read the "protobuf" (shorthand for a protocol buffer file) in any
[supported language](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview#cross-lang),
and then extract and transform just the parts of the data you want.

## Conda - Python

**Optional**: To work with SPC protobufs in Python, you need aditional dependencies dependencies, we have created a conda environment file to assit you to create an independent conda environment to run the scripts included in SPC:

1. You will need conda to set up your enviroment as well as install the requiered dependencies, we recommend install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) as the minimal installer for conda

2. Once miniconda is installed, make sure you are located at `spc` folder and create the environment that will provide the required dependencies.

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Adtional note:
There is a generated Python library you will find in some of the SPC scripts, [synthpop_pb2.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alan-turing-institute/uatk-spc/main/python/synthpop_pb2.py) you can download a copy of this file into your codebase, then `import synthpop_pb2`. You can also generate the file yourself, following the [docs](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/python-generated): `protoc --python_out=python/ synthpop.proto`

## Converting .pb file to JSON format

To interactively explore the data, viewing JSON is much easier. It shows the
same structure as the protobuf, but in a human-readable text format. The
example below uses a [small Python
script](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/uatk-spc/blob/main/python/protobuf_to_json.py):

```shell
# Download a file
wget https://ramp0storage.blob.core.windows.net/spc-output/v1/rutland.pb.gz
# Uncompress
gunzip rutland.pb.gz
# Convert the .pb to JSON
python3 python/protobuf_to_json.py data/output/rutland.pb > rutland.json
# View the output
less rutland.json
```

## Converting to numpy arrays

The [ASPICS](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/uatk-aspics) project simulates the
spread of COVID through a population. The code uses numpy, and [this
script](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/uatk-aspics/blob/main/convert_snapshot.py)
converts the protobuf to a bunch of different numpy arrays.

Note the code doesn't keep using classes from the generated Python code for
protobufs. The protobuf is a format optimized for reading and writing; you
shouldn't use it in your model if there's a more appropriate tool you're
familiar with, like data frames.

## Visualizing the output files.

Use [this
script](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/uatk-spc/blob/main/python/draw_venues.py)
to read a protobuf file, then draws a dot for every venue, color-coded by
activity.
