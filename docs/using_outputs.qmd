title: "SPC Outputs"
toc: true
---

We provide outputs in protocol buffer format for all lieutenancy areas (more commonly known as ceremonial counties) of England, all ITL regions of Wales (international divisions based on the former unified European territorial division system) and all police divisions of Scotland for five reference years. These regions represent coherent territorial units whose scale is particularly well suited to the [modelling methods](understanding_modelling_methods.qmd) used by SPC. In addition, we have included two interesting areas: the Liverpool-Manchester-Leeds arc and the Cambridge to Oxford arc. See [config/](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/uatk-spc/tree/main/config)
for the full list of MSOAs covered by each area.

The [SPC Explorer](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/uatk-spc/app/) can be used to visualise the data, understand what attributes can be obtained form SPC and get inspired about potential applications that could stem from using these outputs.

If you want to run SPC for a different list of MSOAs, [see here](using_custom_areas.qmd).

The data for 2012, 2020, 2022, 2032 & 2039 are available here:

to generate the citation).

## Versioning

Over time, we may add more data to SPC or change the schema. Protocol buffers
are designed to let combinations of new/old code and data files work together,
but we don't intend to use this feature. We may make breaking changes, like
deleting fields. We'll release a new version of the schema and output data
every time and document it here. You should depend on a specific version of the
data output in your code, so new releases don't affect you until you decide to
update.
