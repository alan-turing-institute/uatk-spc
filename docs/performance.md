# Performance

The following tables summarizes the resources SPC needs to run in different areas.

Notes:

- `pb_file_size` refers to the size of the protobuf file in `data/output/`
- The total `runtime` is usually dominated by matching workers to businesses, so `commuting_runtime` gives a breakdown
- Measuring memory usage of Linux processes isn't straightforward, so `memory_usage` should just be a guide
- These measurements were all taken on one developer's laptop, and they don't represent multiple runs. This table just aims to give a general sense of how long running takes.
  - That machine has 16 cores, which matters for the parallelized commuting calculation.
- `scripts/collect_stats.py` produces the table above
