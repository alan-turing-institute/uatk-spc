You don't need to run SPC yourself. See
[config/](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/uatk-spc/tree/main/config)
for the list of MSOAs covered by each study area. If you want to run SPC for a
different list of MSOAs, [see here](custom_areas.qmd).

One of the advantages of using SPC is that help researches to mimic the population characteristics and its iterations through multiples years (see  for more details). So you can replicate what the population might look like across multiple periods of time. Initially check what country you would like to explore, then pick the year to get the outcome file. In case you want to explore it and see how does the data look like, and what attributes are included, load the output in our [SPC Explorer](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/uatk-spc/app/) and get inspired about the potential applications you could co-create using these outcomes.

## Citing

If you use SPC code or data in your work, please cite using the [Zenodo
DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/479038905) (using the bottom-right tool
to generate the citation).

## Versioning

Over time, we may add more data to SPC or change the schema. Protocol buffers
are designed to let combinations of new/old code and data files work together,
but we don't intend to use this feature. We may make breaking changes, like
deleting fields. We'll release a new version of the schema and output data
every time and document it here. You should depend on a specific version of the
data output in your code, so new releases don't affect you until you decide to
update.
