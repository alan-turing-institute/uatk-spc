The Synthetic Population Catalyst (SPC) makes it easier for researchers to work
with synthetic population data in Great Britain. It combines a variety of [data
sources](understanding_data_sources.qmd) and outputs a single file in [protocol buffer
format](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/uatk-spc/blob/main/synthpop.proto),
describing the population and its activities in a given study area. The data include socio-demographic,
health, salary and daily activity data per person, and information about the venues
where people conduct those activities.

SPC outputs can be used to catalyse other projects. Rather than join together
many [raw data sources](understanding_data_sources.qmd) yourself and deal with missing and
messy data, you can leverage SPC's effort and well-documented schema.

A formal [paper](https://doi.org/10.1177/23998083231203066) to describe SPC has been published in Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science.
