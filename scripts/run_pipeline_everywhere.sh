pueue parallel 1

# You can try increasing this to finish jobs faster. Internally each run will
# try to use all CPU cores during the expensive commuting step, but because
# some threads will take much longer to complete, running multiple pipelines
# can still give net wins.

# Clear the output stats file; each job will append a line to it
